# 🔧 Mobile Hotspot Quick Fix

## Current Status:
✅ **Server is running** on `10.167.4.87:8080`  
✅ **Device connections detected** from `10.167.4.79`  
❌ **App trying to connect to old IP** `192.168.0.243:8080`

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Update App Settings
In your POS app, go to **Settings** and change:
- **Server IP**: From `192.168.0.243` → To `10.167.4.87`
- **Server Port**: Keep as `8080`

### 2. Test Connection
After updating, your app should connect immediately to:
- **WebSocket**: `ws://10.167.4.87:8080`
- **HTTP**: `http://10.167.4.87:8080`

### 3. Verify Working
You should see:
- ✅ Connection status: "Connected"
- ✅ Real-time order sync working
- ✅ Server logs showing your device connected

## Auto-Discovery Feature Added
I've enhanced your WiFi sync service with auto-discovery that will:
- 🔍 Automatically detect mobile hotspot IP changes
- 🔄 Try common mobile hotspot IPs when connection fails
- 💾 Save the working IP for future use

Common mobile hotspot IPs it will try:
- `10.167.4.87` (current)
- `172.20.10.1` (iPhone hotspot)
- `192.168.43.1` (Android hotspot)
- `192.168.1.1` (common WiFi)

## Mobile Hotspot Tips:
1. **Keep hotspot device plugged in** - prevents auto-sleep
2. **Don't change hotspot name** - keeps same IP range
3. **Test after reconnecting** - IP might change
4. **Use "Maximize Compatibility" mode** if available

## Next Time:
The auto-discovery feature should automatically find the server even if the IP changes, but you can always manually update in Settings if needed.

**Current Server**: `ws://10.167.4.87:8080` ✅
